OUTLIER DETECTION ANALYSIS REPORT - Bati Bank Credit Risk Modeling
Generated: 2025-12-13 10:57:21
Dataset: 95,662 transactions

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
- Overall outlier percentage: 10.00%
- Fraud correlation detected: YES
- Basel II compliance status: ⚠️ May require documentation and justification

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Statistical Outliers: Multiple methods identified consistent outlier patterns
2. Fraud Correlation: Outliers show 569.95 times higher fraud risk
3. Temporal Patterns: 3 outlier days identified
4. Multi-dimensional Analysis: Complex patterns require advanced detection methods

CRITICAL RISK INDICATORS:
1. High-value transaction anomalies
2. Temporal clustering of outliers
3. Correlation with fraud patterns
4. Impact on model stability

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TASK 3:
1. Implement winsorizing for extreme values
2. Create outlier-aware feature engineering
3. Develop separate fraud detection model
4. Document all treatments for Basel II compliance
5. Establish ongoing outlier monitoring

BASEL II COMPLIANCE ACTIONS:
- Document outlier detection methodology
- Justify treatment decisions statistically
- Validate model stability post-treatment
- Maintain comprehensive audit trail
