Credit Risk Framework for Alternative Data Lending

This project defines credit risk using:

Transactional behavior

Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM)

Product category usage

Channel-level spending

FraudResult indicators

Merchant/Provider risk profiles

Risk drivers include:

High variability in spending

Long inactivity gaps

Reliance on high-risk products (e.g., airtime-only users)

Unusual patterns (e.g., many negative transactions)

Channel-specific risk (e.g., web vs. Android patterns)
