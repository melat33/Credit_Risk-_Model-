Basel II Analysis for Credit Scoring System

The Basel II Accord requires banks to adopt a risk-sensitive framework for credit decisions. Three components are mandatory:

PD (Probability of Default)

LGD (Loss Given Default)

EAD (Exposure at Default)

Basel II also requires:

Full documentation of model design

Model interpretability (banks must explain decisions)

Model validation, back-testing, and governance

Alignment of credit decisions with risk appetite

Use of stable, monotonic transformations like WoE

Because of these rules, traditional scorecards remain common in regulated banks.

Our project follows Basel II by:

Defining PD as the primary output

Documenting all risk assumptions

Justifying proxy labels

Using interpretable modeling methods

Creating governance files under /config/regulatory
