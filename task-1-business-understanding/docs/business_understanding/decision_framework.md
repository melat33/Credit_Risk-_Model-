Credit Decision Framework

We define credit decision logic:

Calculate PD

Apply risk cutoff:

PD < 0.15 → Approve

0.15 ≤ PD < 0.30 → Review

PD ≥ 0.30 → Decline

Determine Credit Limit
Based on spending patterns and risk tier.

Determine Loan Duration
Shorter durations for high-risk customers.

Monitor & Governance
Monthly backtesting
Stability Index check
